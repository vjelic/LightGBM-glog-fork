The function counts the number of characters in a string until it reaches a null character (`\\0`). If the string is not null-terminated, `strlen` will continue reading memory until it encounters a null character, which can lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, and other undefined behavior.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, always ensure that your strings are null-terminated. Avoid using `strlen` on strings that may not be null-terminated. Instead, consider using safer alternatives such as `strnlen`, which takes an additional parameter specifying the maximum length of the string to be considered.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\n```cpp\nconst char* kHdfsProto = \"some string\";\nsize_t kHdfsProtoLength = strnlen(kHdfsProto, MAX_LENGTH);\n```\n\nIn the above code, `MAX_LENGTH` should be the maximum length of `kHdfsProto` that you want to consider. This ensures that `strnlen` does not read beyond this length, even if it does not encounter a null character.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe `strlen` function is part of the C standard library (`<cstring>` in C++), so no additional library dependencies are required for the code example.\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)"

Instead, use safer alternatives provided by the C++ Standard Library. For instance, instead of `std::atoi()`, you can use `std::stoi()` which throws an exception if the conversion fails or if the converted value is out of range.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace `std::atoi()` with `std::stoi()`. Here is the fixed code:\n\n```cpp\ntry {\n    Json(std::stoi(str + start_pos));\n} catch (const std::invalid_argument& ia) {\n    // Handle the exception\n} catch (const std::out_of_range& oor) {\n    // Handle the exception\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `<string>`: for `std::stoi()`\n- `<stdexcept>`: for `std::invalid_argument` and `std::out_of_range`\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/681.html)\n\nPlease note that the links provided are accessible to anonymous users at the time of writing this report."

This can lead to predictable values being generated, which can be exploited by an attacker to predict future values and compromise the security of the system.\n\nThe specific vulnerability sink in the provided code is the use of the `Random()` function, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, use a cryptographically secure random number generator. In C++, this can be achieved using the `<random>` library, which provides a variety of random number generators that are suitable for cryptographic use.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the `Random()` function with a cryptographically secure random number generator. Here is an example of how to do this using the `<random>` library:\n\n```cpp\n#include <random>\n\nstd::random_device rd;\nstd::mt19937 gen(rd());\nstd::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(1, 6);\n\nref_feature_meta[i].rand = dis(gen);\n```\n\nIn this example, `std::random_device` is a uniformly-distributed integer random number generator that produces non-deterministic random numbers. `std::mt19937` is a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random generator of 32-bit numbers with a state size of 19937 bits. `std::uniform_int_distribution` produces random integers in a range [a, b].\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe `<random>` library is required by the code example to execute properly.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)"

This can lead to a variety of security issues, as attackers may be able to predict the generated values and exploit this predictability.\n\nWeak random number generators can lead to predictable patterns, which can be exploited by attackers. For example, if a weak random number generator is used to generate session IDs, an attacker might be able to predict future session IDs and hijack user sessions.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a strong, cryptographic random number generator. In C++, this can be achieved by using the `<random>` library, which provides a variety of random number generators that are suitable for generating unpredictable values.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `<random>` library to generate random numbers in a secure manner:\n\n```cpp\n#include <random>\n\nint main() {\n    std::random_device rd;  // Will be used to obtain a seed for the random number engine\n    std::mt19937 gen(rd()); // Standard mersenne_twister_engine seeded with rd()\n    std::uniform_int_distribution<> distrib(1, 6);\n\n    for (int n=0; n<10; ++n)\n        // Use distrib to transform the random unsigned int generated by gen into an int in [1, 6]\n        std::cout << distrib(gen) << ' ';\n    std::cout << '\\n';\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `std::random_device` is used to generate a seed for the Mersenne Twister random number engine (`std::mt19937`). The `std::uniform_int_distribution` is then used to transform the random unsigned int generated by `gen` into an int in the range [1, 6].\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP - Insecure Randomness](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Insecure_Randomness)\n- [CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)"

One such function is `vsnprintf`.\n\nThe `vsnprintf` function is used to write formatted data from a variable argument list to a sized buffer. However, it can lead to vulnerabilities if not used correctly. For example, if the size of the buffer is not correctly specified, it can lead to buffer overflow, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use safer alternatives to `vsnprintf` whenever possible. For example, consider using `snprintf` instead, which automatically null-terminates the output. Always ensure that the size argument correctly reflects the size of the buffer.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of how to use `snprintf` instead of `vsnprintf`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[50];\n    int a = 10;\n    snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"Integer: %d\", a);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `snprintf` is used to write the formatted data to the buffer.

                "markdown": "## Description\n\n\"Detected Prohibited C Function\" vulnerability refers to the use of insecure C library functions in C++ code. These functions are often prone to buffer overflow attacks, leading to potential security risks such as code execution, memory corruption, and denial of service. The `vprintf` function is one of these insecure functions. It does not check the length of the input, which can lead to buffer overflow.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nAvoid using insecure C library functions that do not check the length of input such as `vprintf`. Instead, use safer alternatives that include bounds checking. In the case of `vprintf`, consider using `vsnprintf` or `vfprintf` which allow for specifying a maximum length of the output.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace `vprintf` with `vsnprintf` or `vfprintf`. Here is an example of how to use `vsnprintf`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <stdarg.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid safe_printf(const char *format, ...) {\n    va_list arg;\n    char buffer[100];\n\n    va_start(arg, format);\n    vsnprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), format, arg);\n    va_end(arg);\n\n    printf(\"%s\", buffer);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `vsnprintf` writes the output to the buffer, ensuring that it does not exceed the size of the buffer, thus preventing buffer overflow.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following libraries:\n\n- stdarg.h\n- stdio.h\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)"

These functions are often referred to as \"banned\" functions. One such function is `sprintf`.\n\nThe `sprintf` function is used to write formatted data to a string. However, it does not check the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow if the source data exceeds the size of the destination buffer. This can cause crashes, data corruption, and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using the `sprintf` function. Instead, use safer alternatives that check the size of the destination buffer, such as `snprintf`.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace `sprintf` with `snprintf`. Here is an example:\n\n```cpp\n// Vulnerable code\nchar buffer[50];\nsprintf(buffer, \"%s\", someString);\n\n// Fixed code\nchar buffer[50];\nsnprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%s\", someString);\n```\n\nIn the fixed code, `snprintf` checks that it does not write more than `sizeof(buffer)` characters, including the null terminator, preventing buffer overflow.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe `sprintf` and `snprintf` functions are part of the C standard library, so no additional library dependencies are required.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)"

If the size `a` is user-controlled and not properly validated, it can lead to various vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, memory corruption, or denial of service.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should:\n\n1. Always validate user input: Never trust user input blindly. Make sure to validate it before using it in your program.\n\n2. Use safe functions: Instead of `malloc()`, consider using functions like `calloc()` which initializes the allocated memory to zero.\n\n3. Check for allocation failures: Always check if `malloc()` successfully allocated the memory. If `malloc()` fails, it returns a NULL pointer.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a simple fix for the `malloc(a)` vulnerability:\n\n```cpp\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// ...\n\nsize_t a;\n// Get the value of 'a' from user input or somewhere else\n// ...\n\n// Validate 'a' before using it\nif (a > MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE) {\n    // Handle the error\n    return;\n}\n\nvoid* ptr = malloc(a);\nif (ptr == NULL) {\n    // Handle the error\n    return;\n}\n\n// Use 'ptr'...\n```\n\nIn this code, we first validate the size `a` before using it in `malloc()`. Then, we check if `malloc()` successfully allocated the memory.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe `malloc()` function is part of the C Standard Library, so you need to include the `stdlib.h` header file in your code.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/131.html)"

Additionally, always check that the source pointer is not null before copying.\n\nExample fix:\n\n```cpp\nif (src != nullptr && src_copy != src) {\n    strncpy(src_copy, src, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN + 1);\n    src_copy[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN] = '\\0';\n} else if (src == src_copy) {\n    // If source and destination are the same, no copy is needed.\n    // Optionally, ensure null-termination.\n    src_copy[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN] = '\\0';\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if overlap is possible and unavoidable, use a function that handles overlapping memory:\n\n```cpp\nif (src != nullptr) {\n    memmove(src_copy, src, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN + 1);\n    src_copy[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN] = '\\0';\n}\n```\n\n## References\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n- [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n\n___\n"

The function counts the number of characters in a string until it reaches a null character (`\\0`). If the string is not null-terminated, `strlen` will continue reading memory until it encounters a null character, potentially leading to buffer overflows, memory corruption, and other undefined behavior.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, always ensure that your strings are null-terminated. Avoid using `strlen` on strings that may not be null-terminated. Instead, consider using safer alternatives that take the size of the buffer as an argument, such as `strnlen`, which will not read past the specified length, even if it does not encounter a null character.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace:\n\n```cpp\nlen = std::strlen(model_str);\n```\n\nWith:\n\n```cpp\nlen = std::strnlen(model_str, MAX_SIZE);\n```\n\nWhere `MAX_SIZE` is the maximum size of `model_str`.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the `<cstring>` library.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html)\n\nPlease note that the links provided are accessible to anonymous users at the time of writing this report."

                "markdown": "This finding is considered a genuine vulnerability because the classification indicates a high risk: the destination buffer's capacity is unknown, and the number of bytes being copied is not proven to be within safe bounds. The destination is a character pointer, and there is no evidence that its size is checked or that the length used for copying is derived from the buffer's actual capacity. There are no explicit guards or null-termination after the copy, and the length argument is not directly tied to the buffer's size. Although the source is a C-style string (which is generally safe from overlap and null pointer issues), the lack of bounds checking on the destination makes this a high-confidence, actionable issue.\n\n## In Context Remediation\nTo remediate this issue, ensure that the number of bytes copied does not exceed the actual size of the destination buffer. Before calling the memory copy function, determine the capacity of the destination buffer and use the smaller of the destination's capacity and the intended copy length. For example:\n\n```cpp\nsize_t dest_capacity = /* actual size of out_str buffer */;\nsize_t copy_len = std::min(dest_capacity, *out_len);\nstd::memcpy(out_str, model.c_str(), copy_len);\n```\n\nIf the destination buffer's size is not known at this point, refactor the code to pass the buffer's capacity as an additional argument, or use a safer string copy function that takes the destination size into account. Always ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the copied data, and consider null-terminating the buffer if it is used as a string.\n\n## References\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n\n___\n"

It is considered unsafe because it does not check the array bounds of the destination buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the source string is larger than the destination buffer.\n\nBuffer overflow vulnerabilities can lead to various security issues, including arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use safer string copy functions that include bounds checking, such as `strncpy`, `strlcpy`, or `memcpy`. These functions require the size of the destination buffer as an argument, which can prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the `strcpy` function with a safer function, such as `strncpy`. Here is an example of how to do this:\n\n```cpp\nstd::strncpy(_array[index], content.c_str(), sizeof(_array[index]) - 1);\n_array[index][sizeof(_array[index]) - 1] = '\\0';\n```\n\nIn this example, `sizeof(_array[index]) - 1` is the size of the destination buffer minus one to leave space for the null terminator. The null terminator is then manually added to the end of the string.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `<cstring>`: This library provides the `strcpy` and `strncpy` functions.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)"

                "markdown": "This finding is classified as a genuine vulnerability because the analysis identified a risk of undefined behavior due to possible overlap between the source and destination memory regions in the memory copy operation. The destination and source expressions are related by data flow, which means they may refer to overlapping memory areas. This can cause unpredictable results or program crashes, as the standard memory copy function does not handle overlapping regions safely. The verdict is supported by the classification and the explicit indication that overlap is feasible. There are no additional guards or checks in place to prevent this issue, and the function call is not protected against this class of error.\n\n## In Context Remediation\nTo prevent undefined behavior when the source and destination memory regions may overlap, replace the standard memory copy function with a function that safely handles overlapping regions. In C++, use `std::memmove` instead of `std::memcpy`, as `std::memmove` is designed to handle overlapping memory areas safely. For example, change the code to:\n\n```cpp\nstd::memmove(REAL(out_data_R), out_data, out_len[0]*sizeof(double));\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the memory copy operation is safe even if the source and destination regions overlap.\n\n## References\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n- [OWASP: Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n___\n"
